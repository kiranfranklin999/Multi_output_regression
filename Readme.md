## This repo is tutorial for exploring various algorithms for Multi-output prediction in ML and DL using a regressor data and understanding them how mathematically they work.

I have explored:
Machine learning algorithms 
- for which the multi-output available as default:
1. Linear regression
2. KNN Regressor
3. Decision Tree Regressor.
4. Random forest. 

- Also, Explored methods that can be used with Algorithms which doesn't support multi-output
1. Chain 
2. Direct
 using SVM

Deep learning algorithms:
1. Simple Feed-forward Neural network
2.
